Description: Explore calcium (Ca) and phosphate (Pi) homeostasis with two novel 'Shiny' apps, 
    building upon on a previously published mathematical model written in C, 
    to ensure efficient computations. The underlying model is accessible
    here <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747359>.
    The first application explores the fundamentals of Ca-Pi homeostasis, 
    while the second provides interactive case studies for in-depth exploration of the topic, 
    thereby seeking to foster student engagement and an integrative understanding of Ca-Pi regulation. 
    These applications are hosted at <https://rinterface.com/AppsPhysiol.html>.
